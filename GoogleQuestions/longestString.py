# Write a function
# class Solution { public String solution(String S); }
# which, given a string S consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, returns the longest consistent fragment of S which begins and ends with the same letter. If there are many possible answers you should return the one starting at the earliest position.
# Examples:
# 1. Given S = "cbaabaab", your function should return "baabaab".
# 2. Given S = "performance", your function should return "erformance".
# 3. Given S = "cat", your function should return "c".
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
# 	•	the length of S is within the range [1..100,000];
# 	•	string S consists only of lowercase letters (a−z).
