# You are given an array of integers. Your task is to create pairs of them, such that every created pair has the same sum. 
# This sum is not specified, but the number of created pairs should be the maximum possible. 
# Each array element may belong to one pair only.
# Write a function:
# class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
# that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum possible number of pairs with the same sum.
# Examples:
# 1. Given A = [1, 9, 8, 100, 2], the function should return 2. The pairs are (A[0], A[1]) and (A[2], A[4]); the sum of each pair is 10.
# 2. Given A = [2, 2, 2, 3], the function should return 1. Although, for instance, A[0]+A[1] = A[0]+A[2], the pairs (A[0], A[1]) and 
#    (A[0], A[2]) cannot exist at the same time, because they both contain a common element, A[0].
# 3. Given A = [5, 5], the function should return 1.
# Assume that:
# 	•	N is an integer within the range [2..50];
# 	•	each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000].
# In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
